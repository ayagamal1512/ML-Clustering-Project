# ML-Clustering-Project
### Objective:
  - Use KMeans Cluster algorithm on unknown Penguin species dataset to figure the number of clusters, but i took it further and applied some of the concepts I've learnt   
- This project is a part of a course **Machine Learning with Python** and in this project I've learnt about:
    
  1- Clustering for Dataset Exploration:
  
        - Learn how to discover underlying groups (clusters) in a dataset.
        - Cluster companies using stock market prices.
        - Distinguish different species by clustering their measurements.
  
  2- Decorrelating Your Data and Dimension Reduction:
  
        - Dimension reduction summarizes a dataset using common patterns.
        - Explore the fundamental technique called Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
        - PCA improves model performance and generalization in supervised learning.
        - Employ a variant of PCA to cluster Wikipedia articles based on their content.
  
  3- Visualization with Hierarchical Clustering and t-SNE:
  
        - Learn two unsupervised learning techniques for data visualization:
        - Hierarchical clustering: Visualize hierarchical relationships.
        - t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding): Reduce high-dimensional data for visualization.

However this project did not include this part of the course as it's part of NLP,I found it really interesting.

  4- Dimension Reduction Technique called "Non-negative matrix factorization" ("NMF")
  
        - Expresses samples as combinations of interpretable parts. For example, it expresses documents as combinations of topics,
           and images in terms of commonly occurring visual patterns.
        - Learn how to use NMF to build recommender systems that can find you similar articles to read, or musical artists that match your listening history!
